kmeans on 2 dimensions:
1 cluster with 23 observations overlapping with 1 cluster with 15 observations
1 cluster with 2 observations: beef and lamb
1 cluster with 3 observations: coffee, dark chocolate, beef (dairy herd), but with beef closer to lamb

kmeans on three dimensions:
3 clusters still overlap
1 cluster with 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43: coffee, dark chocolate, beef (beef and dairy herd), lamb, pig meat, poultry meat, milk, cheese, eggs, fish (farmed), shrimps (farmed) --> looks like it grouped all animal products. -> better fit than before!

kmeans on tsne dimensions to visualize better:

1 cluster with: 1, 2, 7, 12, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33
wheat (bread), maize (meal), cassava, nuts, tomatoes, brassicas, other vegetables, citrus fruit, bananas, apples, berries and grapes, wine, other fruits, dark chocolate (closer to number 32 in the last cluster)
By looking at the means of the variables (cluster 3), this group looks like the least polluting one for all the variables considered (all negative values).

1 cluster with: 3, 8, 9, 14, 15, 39
barley (beer), cane sugar, beet sugar, soymilk, tofu, milk.
cluster 2: they have the highest means in transport and retail, while all other variables are negative.

1 cluster with: 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 22, 23, 41
oatmeal, rice, potatoes, other pulses, peas, groundnuts, onions and leeks, root vegetables, eggs
cluster 4: share very similar values with cluster 3, but even less polluting in land use, transport, eutrophication, gas emissions.

1 cluster with: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43
soybean oil, palm oil, sunflower oil, coffee, beef (beef and dairy), lamb and mutton, pig meat, poultry, cheese, fish (farmed), shrimps (farmed).
cluster 1: positive values in all the variables, some even relatively high (animal feed, farm, processing, packaging, eutrophication are all above 0.75).

Hierarchical with ward linkage
cluster 1 contains almost all data points: looking at the means, it seems like the one that pollutes the least (nearly all negative values).
cluster 2 (32, 33: coffee and dark chocolate): high values for packaging, eutrophication, gas emissions; low value fos liters consumption 
cluster 3(43, 36: beef (beef herd) and lamb & mutton): positive values for all variables except for transport and packaging: quite polluting.
cluster 4 (35, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43: beef (dairy herd), pig meat, poultry meat, cheese,fish (farmed), shrimps (farmed)): very high values in land use, farm, processing, total emissions.
